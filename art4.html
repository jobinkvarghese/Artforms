                      The Sattriya dance form has its origin in the ‘Sattras’. Srimanta Sankardev was the bone who established it in the 15th and the 16th century. Sattriya dance is spiritual in nature. Since they were for propagation of neo-Vaishnavism. Still, latterly they came the religious, artistic, and social mecca for the people of Assam. Sattriya is piecemeal from other classical dance forms as it has its unique charm and grace, which evocatively endue it with the bhakti rasa. The word ‘Sattra’ gave this dance its name. It was firstly performed in the Sattras and the Namghars by the manly Bhokots as a part of religious ritual, and for several centuries it was confined within the four walls of the Sattras. Also. it was for spreading the gospel of Vaishnavism.

                      Formerly, virgin monks performed the dance, and womanish places also legislated by them. A revolutionary change took place when womanish hop started performing this art form. Ultimately, on 15th November 2000, the Sangeet Natak Akademi declared Sattriya Dance as a classical dance form of India The Sattriya tradition gets handed down orally from one generation to another, and in this process also undergoes lyrical and metrical extemporizations. The geographic position of the tradition ranges from the vast breadth of the Brahmaputra Valley in Assam and corridor of the Barak vale in southern Assam to some areas in the Arunachal Pradesh, east Cooch Behar, and West Bengal.
